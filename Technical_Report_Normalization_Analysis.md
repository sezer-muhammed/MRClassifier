## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of an advanced hybrid normalization pipeline designed for multi-modal medical image processing. The pipeline implements modality-specific normalization strategies: pure local normalization for MRI (α=0.0) and hybrid global-local normalization for PET (α=0.3). The analysis demonstrates successful handling of problematic values (NaN/Inf) and effective range mapping through hyperbolic tangent transformation.

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Normalization Pipeline Architecture

The implemented pipeline follows a 5-step process:

1. **Finite Value Extraction**: Calculate statistics ignoring NaN/Inf values
2. **Hybrid Statistics Computation**: Combine global and local statistics using modality-specific α values
3. **Z-score Normalization**: Apply standardization using hybrid statistics
4. **Problematic Value Handling**: Replace NaN→0, Inf→1, -Inf→-1
5. **Range Mapping**: Apply tanh function for bounded [-1,1] output

### 1.2 Modality-Specific Configuration

| Modality | Alpha (α) | Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| MRI | 0.0 | Pure Local | High inter-subject variability requires individual adaptation |
| PET | 0.3 | Hybrid (30% Global + 70% Local) | Balance between standardization and local characteristics |

### 1.3 Global Statistics

**MRI Global Parameters:**
- Mean: 571.25 ± 1105.95
- High variability indicates diverse intensity ranges across subjects

**PET Global Parameters:**
- Mean: 0.505 ± 0.643
- More consistent range typical of standardized uptake values

## 2. Results Analysis

### 2.1 Original Data Characteristics

**MRI Original Distribution:**
- Range: [0, 9,211] with extreme right skew (skewness: 7.21)
- High kurtosis (67.43) indicating heavy tails and outliers
- Median (57) << Mean (189.35), confirming positive skew

**PET Original Distribution:**
- Contains NaN values requiring special handling
- More constrained value range typical of SUV measurements

### 2.2 Normalization Effectiveness

#### 2.2.1 MRI Results (α=0.0 - Pure Local)

**After Local Normalization:**
- Successfully centered: Mean ≈ 0.003, Std ≈ 1.0
- Reduced skewness from 7.21 to 0.95
- Normalized kurtosis to near-zero (-0.004)

**Final Distribution (Post-Tanh):**
- Mean: -0.083 ± 0.664
- Range: [-0.738, 1.000]
- Balanced distribution: 41.0% positive values
- Effective range utilization: 87% of [-1,1] span

#### 2.2.2 PET Results (α=0.3 - Hybrid)

**After Hybrid Normalization:**
- Mean: -0.017 ± 0.990
- Maintained standardization while preserving local characteristics
- Reduced coefficient of variation in hybrid means (0.074 vs 0.108 for pure local)

**Final Distribution (Post-Tanh):**
- Mean: -0.127 ± 0.583
- Range: [-0.684, 1.000]
- Distribution: 26.6% positive values
- Effective range utilization: 84% of [-1,1] span

### 2.3 Statistical Quality Metrics

#### 2.3.1 Distribution Balance
- **MRI**: Well-balanced with 41% positive values, minimal zero-clustering (0.36%)
- **PET**: Slightly negative-skewed with 26.6% positive values, higher zero-clustering (9.8%)

#### 2.3.2 Range Utilization
- **MRI**: Excellent utilization (1.74/2.0 = 87% of theoretical range)
- **PET**: Good utilization (1.68/2.0 = 84% of theoretical range)
- Both modalities avoid saturation at bounds (minimal values near ±1)

#### 2.3.3 Inter-Image Consistency

**MRI Local Statistics Variability:**
- Mean CV: 1.51 (high variability, justifying α=0.0)
- Std CV: 1.47 (consistent with high inter-subject differences)

**PET Hybrid Statistics Stability:**
- Hybrid mean CV: 0.074 (reduced from 0.108 local-only)
- Hybrid std CV: 0.062 (improved consistency)
- Demonstrates effectiveness of global influence

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an early Alzheimer's disease detection system using paired T1-weighted MRI and ^18F-FDG PET brain imaging volumes. The system aims to achieve clinical-grade performance with AUC ≥ 0.95, Sensitivity ≥ 88%, and Specificity ≥ 89% on 5-fold cross-validated ADNI/OASIS-3 datasets. The solution will use a Swin-UNETR architecture with cross-attention fusion to process multimodal neuroimaging data for prodromal/early Alzheimer's detection.

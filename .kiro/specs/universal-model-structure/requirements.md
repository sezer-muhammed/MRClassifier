# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a universal model structure with Pydantic objects for input/output handling and a base PyTorch class for consistent model interfaces. The focus is on parametric initialization with shape, channel, and feature dimension specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Pydantic input objects so that I can pass validated tensor data with automatic shape checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating model inputs THEN the system SHALL provide Pydantic classes with tensor fields for imaging and clinical data
2. WHEN validating inputs THEN the system SHALL check tensor shapes match expected dimensions (H, W, D, channels)
3. WHEN handling batch data THEN the system SHALL validate batch dimensions and tensor types
4. WHEN detecting invalid shapes THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with expected dimensions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Pydantic output objects so that I can receive structured prediction results with metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL return Pydantic objects with prediction tensors and confidence scores
2. WHEN processing results THEN the system SHALL include model metadata like architecture type and version
3. WHEN handling uncertainty THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals when available
4. WHEN serializing outputs THEN the system SHALL support JSON export of prediction results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a base PyTorch model class so that I can create consistent model interfaces with parametric initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing models THEN the system SHALL accept input_shape (H, W, D), in_channels, and clinical_features_size parameters
2. WHEN creating models THEN the system SHALL inherit from PyTorch Lightning with standardized forward/training methods
3. WHEN configuring architectures THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate layer dimensions based on input parameters
4. WHEN validating parameters THEN the system SHALL ensure shape compatibility and provide dimension calculations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want flexible Pydantic field definitions so that I can extend input/output objects for different model types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining input fields THEN the system SHALL support imaging tensors, clinical features, metadata, and custom fields
2. WHEN specifying output fields THEN the system SHALL support predictions, probabilities, attention maps, and model info
3. WHEN extending schemas THEN the system SHALL allow inheritance and custom field validators
4. WHEN handling different data types THEN the system SHALL support optional fields and default values

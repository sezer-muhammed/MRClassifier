# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a hybrid deep learning model for Alzheimer's detection that combines 3D brain imaging data (MRI + PET) with clinical features. The model uses a SwinUNet3D backbone for image processing and a compact MLP for clinical features, fusing both modalities to predict Alzheimer's scores. The system is designed for PyTorch Lightning training with FP16 precision and configurable input shapes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to implement a hybrid model architecture that processes both imaging and clinical data, so that I can leverage multimodal information for Alzheimer's detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is initialized THEN the system SHALL accept image input with configurable shape (Batch × 2 × H × W × D)
2. WHEN clinical features are processed THEN the system SHALL accept 116 clinical features as input
3. WHEN image processing is performed THEN the system SHALL use SwinUNet3D with depths=[2,2,6,2], num_heads=[3,6,12,24], dropout_path_rate=0.1
4. WHEN clinical processing is performed THEN the system SHALL use MLP layers: 116→64→32→32→16
5. WHEN feature fusion occurs THEN the system SHALL combine 96 image features with 16 clinical features
6. WHEN final prediction is made THEN the system SHALL output a single Alzheimer's score

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want configurable input shapes for the model, so that I can adapt to different image resolutions and preprocessing pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model configuration is set THEN the system SHALL accept target_size parameter for image dimensions
2. WHEN dataset is initialized THEN the system SHALL pass target_size to preprocessing pipeline
3. WHEN model is created THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt to the configured input shape
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL verify input shape compatibility
5. WHEN preprocessing occurs THEN the system SHALL resize/pad images to match target_size

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want robust model persistence capabilities, so that I can save, load, and resume training efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model saving is requested THEN the system SHALL save complete model state including architecture and weights
2. WHEN model loading is performed THEN the system SHALL restore exact model state and configuration
3. WHEN checkpointing is enabled THEN the system SHALL save intermediate training states
4. WHEN model export is needed THEN the system SHALL support both PyTorch and ONNX formats
5. WHEN version control is required THEN the system SHALL include metadata with saved models

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want PyTorch Lightning integration with FP16 training, so that I can efficiently train on GPU hardware with mixed precision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lightning module is implemented THEN the system SHALL inherit from pl.LightningModule
2. WHEN training is configured THEN the system SHALL support FP16 automatic mixed precision
3. WHEN optimization is set up THEN the system SHALL implement configurable optimizer and scheduler
4. WHEN metrics are tracked THEN the system SHALL log training and validation losses
5. WHEN GPU utilization is optimized THEN the system SHALL efficiently use available VRAM

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model validation and testing, so that I can ensure the architecture works correctly with real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model is instantiated THEN the system SHALL validate input/output shapes
2. WHEN forward pass is tested THEN the system SHALL process sample batches without errors
3. WHEN gradient flow is verified THEN the system SHALL ensure all parameters receive gradients
4. WHEN memory usage is checked THEN the system SHALL fit within reasonable GPU memory limits
5. WHEN integration is tested THEN the system SHALL work seamlessly with the existing dataloader

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want modular and extensible architecture, so that I can experiment with different components and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architecture is designed THEN the system SHALL separate image and clinical processing modules
2. WHEN fusion strategy is implemented THEN the system SHALL allow different fusion approaches
3. WHEN hyperparameters are configured THEN the system SHALL support easy parameter modification
4. WHEN components are replaced THEN the system SHALL allow swapping of backbone architectures

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive data analysis system for the Gazimed Alzheimer's disease detection database. The system will generate detailed statistical reports, visualizations, and insights about the dataset to support research and model development decisions. The analysis will include demographic distributions, clinical feature correlations, data quality assessments, and age stratification with 5 age bins instead of binary grouping.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to generate comprehensive statistical reports about the Gazimed database, so that I can understand the dataset characteristics and make informed decisions about model development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis system is executed THEN it SHALL generate a complete markdown report with all statistical findings
2. WHEN analyzing demographics THEN the system SHALL bin ages into 5 equal groups instead of binary classification
3. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL include mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for all numerical variables
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include data distribution visualizations and summary tables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to analyze correlations between clinical features and Alzheimer's scores, so that I can identify the most predictive features for model development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing clinical features THEN the system SHALL calculate correlation coefficients between each feature and Alzheimer's score
2. WHEN identifying correlations THEN the system SHALL rank features by absolute correlation strength
3. WHEN presenting correlations THEN the system SHALL generate correlation matrices and heatmaps
4. WHEN analyzing feature relationships THEN the system SHALL identify highly correlated feature pairs to detect potential redundancy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to understand data quality and completeness, so that I can plan appropriate preprocessing strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing data quality THEN the system SHALL report missing value percentages for all columns
2. WHEN validating data integrity THEN the system SHALL identify outliers and anomalous values
3. WHEN checking file accessibility THEN the system SHALL verify that all MRI and PET file paths exist
4. WHEN analyzing completeness THEN the system SHALL report the percentage of subjects with complete data across all modalities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a clinical researcher, I want to analyze demographic distributions and their relationship with Alzheimer's outcomes, so that I can understand population characteristics and potential biases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing age distribution THEN the system SHALL create 5 equal-sized age bins and report Alzheimer's rates for each bin
2. WHEN examining sex distribution THEN the system SHALL calculate Alzheimer's rates by gender and test for statistical significance
3. WHEN comparing dataset sources THEN the system SHALL analyze differences between ADNI and GAZI populations
4. WHEN generating demographic reports THEN the system SHALL include cross-tabulations and statistical tests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to visualize data distributions and relationships, so that I can identify patterns and communicate findings effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL generate histograms for all continuous variables
2. WHEN showing relationships THEN the system SHALL create scatter plots between key variables
3. WHEN displaying categorical data THEN the system SHALL use bar charts and pie charts appropriately
4. WHEN presenting correlations THEN the system SHALL generate heatmaps and correlation plots

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want an automated report generation system, so that I can regularly monitor dataset characteristics and changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing the analysis THEN the system SHALL generate a complete markdown report automatically
2. WHEN running analysis THEN the system SHALL save all visualizations as high-quality image files
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and dataset version information
4. WHEN completing analysis THEN the system SHALL provide executive summary with key findings and recommendations

# Gazimed: Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection System

**Advanced AI-powered early detection of Alzheimer's disease using paired MRI and PET brain imaging**

---

## üß† Clinical Overview

Gazimed is a state-of-the-art deep learning system designed to assist clinicians in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. By analyzing paired T1-weighted MRI and ^18F-FDG PET brain scans alongside clinical features, our system provides continuous risk scores (0-1) to support clinical decision-making.

### Key Clinical Benefits

- **Early Detection**: Identifies Alzheimer's risk before severe cognitive decline
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines structural (MRI) and metabolic (PET) brain imaging
- **Clinical Integration**: Incorporates 118 clinical features for comprehensive assessment
- **Explainable AI**: Provides attention maps highlighting relevant brain regions
- **Validated Approach**: Built on established medical imaging datasets (ADNI, OASIS-3)

```

### Technical Architecture

1. **Preprocessing**: N4 bias correction, MNI152 registration, normalization
2. **Feature Extraction**: 3D Swin Transformer with shifted window attention
3. **Multimodal Fusion**: Cross-attention between MRI/PET and clinical data
4. **Risk Assessment**: Continuous score output with confidence intervals
5. **Explainability**: Attention visualization for clinical interpretation

## üìä Target Clinical Performance

We aim to achieve the following performance metrics through our validation studies:

| Metric | Target Performance | Clinical Significance |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **AUC-ROC** | 0.90+ | Excellent discrimination ability |
| **Sensitivity** | 85%+ | High detection of positive cases |
| **Specificity** | 85%+ | Low false positive rate |
| **Correlation** | r = 0.80+ | Strong agreement with clinical scores |

### Validation Datasets
- **ADNI**: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
- **OASIS-3**: Open Access Series of Imaging Studies
- **AIBL**: Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Study

## üîç Explainable AI Features

### Attention Visualization
The system provides clinically interpretable attention maps highlighting:

- **Hippocampus**: Memory formation and early AD pathology
- **Entorhinal Cortex**: Gateway to hippocampal formation
- **Posterior Cingulate**: Default mode network alterations
- **Precuneus**: Early metabolic changes in AD

### Clinical Validation Tools
- Anatomical region overlap metrics
- Attention consistency across similar cases
- Correlation with known AD biomarkers
- Comparison with radiologist assessments

# Analyze a case
result = detector.predict(
    mri_path='patient_001_T1.nii.gz',
    pet_path='patient_001_FDG.nii.gz',
    clinical_features=clinical_data
)

print(f"Alzheimer's Risk Score: {result.risk_score:.3f}")
print(f"Confidence Interval: [{result.ci_lower:.3f}, {result.ci_upper:.3f}]")

# Generate clinical report
report = detector.generate_report(result)
report.save('patient_001_report.pdf')
```
